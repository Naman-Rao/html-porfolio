<h3> A SILENT VOICE </h3>
<p>
This movie is a real tear-jerker. It's about a person who bullies am impaired girl when she was young.
<br/>
But when they grow up, he falls in love with her even putting his life in danger trying to save her.
</p>
<h3> MY OWN life </h3>
<p>
My own life isn't less than a movie. There's always some kind of shit going on with me. Sometimes it depressing to look at, sometimes its downright comical out of a comic strip.
<br/>
But I still go on with it.
</p>
<h3> NOTHING </h3>
<p> Sadly I don't watch much movies. I get bored easily. That's the reason why it's so damn hard to name a few movies. haha....</p>
